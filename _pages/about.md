Hi! my name is Timothy Fleagle, I am a physical therapist and PhD student at the University of Iowa in the department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences. My work has focused on the measurment of movement-evoked pain and non-operative treatments for musculoskeletal pain conditions specifically Achilles tendinopathy and Knee osteoarthritis.

Background
======
My academic history began at Wartburg College where I recieved my BA in Biology. I did my clinical training at the Univeristy of Iowa recieving my Doctorate in Physicl Therapy. My clinical practice bridged across multiple clinical settings including the medical intesnive care unit and outpatient clinical settings.
